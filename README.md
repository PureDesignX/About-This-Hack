# About This Hack
Discover your hardware on macOS with this simple, user-friendly hardware info app that retains the beloved design language of the classic 'About This Mac' interface, while gaining access to a wealth of additional features. Our app provides comprehensive information, including AMD Processor Support, display resolution, and much more. Whether you're on a Hackintosh or a real Mac, experience the best of all worlds with this intuitive and informative tool.<br>

# Overview of Features

In the app, there are four tabs on a tab bar at the top of the window, and each one visually presents some information about your system.

The Overview tab presents standard system specifications, such as computer model, OS, processor, etc. The app also shows the Clover or OpenCore bootloader version, if applicable. There is also a tooltip if you hover over your GPU(s) and your bootloader, as the text can often extend beyond the window's size.
